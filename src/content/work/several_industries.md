Over a period of nearly ten years, I have worked in various industries, primarily focusing on embedded software development.  
I have developed reactive power compensation equipment in the power industry, weighing equipment in the petrochemical industry, data acquisition equipment in the environmental protection industry, and surgical robots in the medical industry.  
Working experience in different industries has given me an in-depth understanding of embedded devices across various domains, helped me accumulate rich development experience, and enabled me to apply different technologies across multiple fields.
